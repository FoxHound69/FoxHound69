<h2>Interest in IT </h2> 
</font>

I am keenly interested in programming and artificial intelligence. My interest in IT stems from artificial intelligence when I first saw it in a film. After that, I learned that programming is the most essential foundation for learning artificial intelligence. <br />Furthermore, I understand that it is necessary to acquire the basic knowledge of information technology in order to start learning artificial intelligence. Having learned some basic knowledge of programming, I become very interested in it as it makes me feel like talking with a computer.<br />

The information technology of RMIT has a good practicality and high employment rate. <br />Furthermore, RMIT University ranks high in Australia. Strong practicality can help me find work faster and adapt to new working environment more quickly. On the other hand, RMIT is located in CBD with convenient transportation, which is good for me to find a part-time job regarding information technology. As widely known, RMIT's advanced information technology is also one of the essential reasons for me to choose it.
<br />
I expect to learn programming and artificial intelligence. I also want to learn the knowledge related to machine learning if I have the opportunity. Furthermore, I want to learn about user interface design since a convenient user interface design can attract a great number of users. Furthermore, the design of RMIT University is very creative and practical. <br />

The results of these tests will allow me to recognize myself more clearly. Nonetheless, these tests cannot be completely relied upon. I should properly use these test results to identify my own deficiencies and then correct them. Through the results, I realise that I should strengthen my social skills.<br />

These results may affect my social behaviour in the team. According to the results, I know that I am socially weak. Thus, I will try to social with others more within the team.<br />

While forming a team, I should look for people who are good at socializing. As the team is a group cooperation, better social cooperation capabilities can make it easier for others to understand the ideas. With no doubt, the ability of individuals to solve problems is of great importance because if one cannot even complete his/her own work, there will be no more exchanges and cooperation. On the other hand, management ability is also very significant. A person with strong managerial ability can make a team operate more orderly.

<h2>Project Ideas </h2> 
</font>

I am passionate about programming and artificial intelligence. I want to see the innovation about artificial intelligence, such as robot self-learning. And I consider a simple artificial intelligence project will help me develop the skills, experience and knowledge for my ideal job. <br />

My project idea is an artificial intelligence transport drone which can be utilised to quickly deliver things like takeaways and parcels. In fact, the artificial intelligence transport drone is most suitable for short-term transportation of parcels that are needed in a hurry. The drone relies entirely on computer operation since it is artificial intelligence. The size of the drone is like a normal backpack. Thus, it does not take up too much space. Furthermore, the drone has an identification function to confirm whether the recipient is a buyer. Furthermore, the drone has a GPS function so that the buyer can check the position of the drone in real time during transportation.<br />

The artificial intelligence drone project will be very useful to solving the problems of delivery speed and loss. The home delivery notice card would be left in the mailbox with one in four people (24%) having experienced this problem. Other problems include unreasonable delay (23%), a missing parcel or failure to deliver (14%) and the parcel left in a vulnerable position (11%) (Castle 2016). These problems can be completed avoided by transportation. The drones can call or send a text message to remind or even play a ringtone to alert when it arrives. Furthermore, the entire shipping process depends on the computer. Thereby, the chance of losing or damaging the package is much lower.<br />

Artificial intelligence transport drones have been applied in transporting parcels and takeaways. Its greatest feature is that it can quickly deliver goods when compared to traditional express delivery means. It is suitable for short-haul and fast transportation as the size of the drones determines that the battery cannot support long-term transport. It will calculate whether the remaining power supports the next flight. If there is insufficient power, it will automatically return. The enclosure of the drone is made of solar panels and can be charged during the flight. Besides, the entire transportation process is completely controlled by computers. Furthermore, both sellers and buyers need to operate on mobile phones. Thereby, the mistakes caused by manual intervention can be avoided. The drone will use GPS to precisely position it to ensure it is transported to the correct location. If a special reason causes interruption to the drone network, the drone will return instead of continuing to transport. This will prevent the parcel from being delivered to the wrong place. Furthermore, the transport drone is in the air. Thus, it will not be affected by local traffic and it is a straight flight. In this way, the delivery time can be greatly saved. Furthermore, the drone uses electricity to fly. Hence, it will not cause great pollution to the environment and use solar energy to produce electricity. Artificial intelligence transport drone will not be affected by holidays due to computer control. It is worth noting that transport drones-based GPS technology allows users to query locations at any time during transportation. The drones can also utilise the weather information to identify whether to advance or to delay the transport. The drone contains intelligent recognition that can accurately identify the recipient. It can effectively avoid the delivery of courier or delivery to the wrong person. Meanwhile, the recipient can also receive it outside the designated receiving location. The only requirement is to change the address on the mobile phone. This can save a lot of time while compared to traditional courier services that send emails to change addresses. The artificial intelligence transport drone also contains emergency functions. Even if it suddenly encounters inclement weather or bird attacks, it can stop transporting on the premise of protecting the goods. In addition, there will be a drone charging post on the roof, which will help the drone to charge quickly to ensure high-intensity transportation services. The drone is equipped with a scanner to scan the parcel during transportation and transmit the information back to the computer for inspection. People should be prevented from using drone to transport prohibited items, such as drugs and guns. The drone will also be equipped with cameras to scan the streets and update the maps to prevent street changes. To assure the safety of goods and drone, no one will undergo regular inspections, maintenance and repairs. <br />

Firstly, drone needs artificial intelligence algorithms. For instance, the algorithm is divided into Logistic Regression, Graph Inference and Averaged One-Dependence Estimators. Secondly, the hardware needs to transport drone as graphics processing unit, including the Field Programmable Gate Array and Application specific Integrated Circuit. Furthermore, Drone needs to utilise a database as the drone's route needs to be calculated with the usage of the database's map. Furthermore, the drone hardware also needs to use the main processing controller, mainly through the type processor (MPU), microprocessor (MCU), digital signal processor (DSP) and solar shell. Furthermore, both of scanners and cameras are needed for facial recognition, map detection and package scanning.<br />

One of the most significant skills is programming, as the basis of all the steps. R language and python are necessary skills. Moreover, it is important to use algorithms skilfully to transport drone in order to make it run steadily. Besides, an in-depth understanding of the hardware, and the clear, basic principles of each hardware operation are needed. There is a high feasibility of learning these skills as some software are not yet mature. Furthermore, some of the hardware needed for transporting drone have already existed. Therefore, the realization of this project is not far away and the basic software and hardware have already existed. <br />

If the project succeeds, it will bring about a huge transformation to the transportation industry. To be more specific, the speed of express delivery has increased significantly and the loss of parcels has decreased. Transporting drone would cause less pollution to the environment. And people's lives will no longer be affected by the speed and quality of express delivery. The process of express delivery will be basically completed by computer operations, and will no longer be affected by holidays. In addition to this, the rate of artificial errors will be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the implementation of this project will have a huge impact on the development of artificial intelligence.<br />
