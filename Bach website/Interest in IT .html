								<h2><a href="#">Interest in IT</a></h2>
								<p>
									below are the reasons why I choose to study IT at RMIT
								</p>

							<section><p> When I was a kid, I used to addicted to computer games and I like technology. During my secondary school, I was curious about
how games were made, and I wanted to create an amazing game in the future but I don't know how at that time. Unlike some of the kids want to be a police, a doctor, a solider,... in the future, I didn't have any plans about
what job I will choose in the future until my high school period. At grade 10, I started to study Pascal. I have to admit that at first I found it very boring and meaningless. after knowing that
actually games/apps were created by different languages such as Pascal, c++, python, java... I used to think computer was very smart, but actually it is completely stupid and we ourself make it
to be smart, to function. I was excited about computer stuffs from that and decided to become a programmer in the future so I can create my own apps for practical purposes. <br></section>
<section>IT is not a developed carreer in my country, so I decided to study abroad. Luckily, I have 2 cousins who are programmers living in Melbourne so I chose to study here. I have my own experience studying in RMIT in Viet Nam, on 
its opening day to students. I like the way how RMIT teach, as a result, I chose RMIT. Furthermore, RMIT is one of the best university to study IT in Melbourne with state-of-the-art facility, education system. Having a chance
to study here is a big opportunity for me in the future.<br></section>
<section>I expect to know most of the concepts using in programming during studying in RMIT so when I graduate, I can be able to apply for a good job. I just started studying here, I hope I can learn IT as much as possible.</section>

									Nowadays, people are too busy that they rarely have time to spend on going outside and have a meal at a restaurant. What if people can have a perfect meal from any restaurants they want at home or anywhere they want at any time?
