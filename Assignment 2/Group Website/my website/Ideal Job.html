<section> <p> Nowadays, thank to the development of smart phone, individuals can be more convinient in their life. The needs of upgrading functionalities lead to the improvement of smart phone so that it can adapt with people requirements and serve with useful purposes <br>
The job offers me with a perfect position where I can work with professional team, to develop creative projects that can improve the function of Android smart phone. Having a chance to work as a team, and work on brilliant projects can help me to reach a next level in IT career.
In other words, I can learn a lot of things, get experiences from high-profile teamates. The job does not give out the salary offer, but I think it does not matter to me. My first Ideal job is the job that I can learn from how professional people do in IT career.

<section> <header> To become an Android Developer, I need to acquire these knowledges:</header>
<p>
+ Strong knowledge of Android SDK, know how to deal with different version of Android.<br>
+ Design, maintain the applications.<br>
+ Able to use some specific tools such as: JavaRx, Dagger, Retrofit, Java 8, ButterKnife, Mockito.<br>
+ Have practices in Android UI design.<br>
+ Able to develop teamwork when work as a team.<br>
</p>

<section> <p>Until now, I just know some of the basic concepts in programing and UCD area and I rarely had time to work as a team before university. It is a long tough way for me to achieve this position but I still have time to improve myself.
In the next following time during studying in RMIT, I will try my best to improve myself. This could be by several of ways. Firstly, except from studying at university, attend lectures, I can self-learn somethings on the Internet or ask for help 
from my cousins. Secondly, luckily that there will be a lot of group assignments during university time, so that I can develop my teamwork. Last but not least, to start having some of the project ideas and look at it is a good option for me to practice
and learn IT from now. I am not sure that I will keep on that job in the next following years or not, but every improvements could build up my status for my future job resume.</p>
