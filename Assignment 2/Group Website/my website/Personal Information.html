								<section> Hello! My full name is Bach Truong Dao, student ID: s3673712. I am an international student, come from Vietnam. I was born in Hai Phong
city, which is located in the North of Vietnam. I was a student of Tran Phu high school - school for the gifted, physics was my major in high school. Having finished 3 years high shool, 
I decided to study abroad. For me, studying abroad is a big opportunity for me, and I was really looking forward to it. But my English was bad, actually it is still terrible until now and I still trying to 
improve my English. <br></section>
								<section>I consider myself as an active person. I love sports, especially soccer and badminton. I used to join some of the sport competitions 
in my high school but have not received any winner price, yet. However, I am still practicing to be better. I also love music, Tropical house type. I usually listen to Kygo songs when I study, work-out,
go on my way to school,...  <br></section>
					<section>			When I moved here - Melbourne, everything was very new to me, from food, weather, language to public transport and school stuffs... I found a lot
of difficulties in my daily. I have got lost at least 2 times already since I moved here and I feel terrible homesick too. However, I am living with my 2 cousins, they help me a lot with starting a new life here.
 My 2 cousins also studied IT, one chose RMIT, the other chose Swinbourne, and they are now working as a programmer for big company now. I always look up to my 2 cousins, try my best to be like them in the future. <br>

									Nowadays, people are too busy that they rarely have time to spend on going outside and have a meal at a restaurant. What if people can have a perfect meal from any restaurants they want at home or anywhere they want at any time?
